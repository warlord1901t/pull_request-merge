# pull_request-merge

When working on open source projects in GitHub, developers must be able to test out new code changes without affecting the main project.

To do so, they can create a new branch and implement their code changes. They can then commit each change to their local repository and include a commit message to convey what each change does.

When they’re done, they’ll submit a pull request to the project maintainer on GitHub. This is essentially a request to implement changes into the main branch.

Once you look over the code and determine it's good to go, you’ll have to merge their branch into the master branch.

Below, we’ll explain how to merge branches in GitHub. But first, let’s talk a little more about pull requests.

#About pull requests
As mentioned, a pull request occurs when a developer proposes that the changes they made to the code on their local branch are ready to be implemented into the main branch.

All the developer has to do is navigate to the local branch in GitHub they want to merge, then click New pull request. From there, they can enter a few details before submitting the request.
